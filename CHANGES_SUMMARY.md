# Changes Summary - Filter Improvements

## Issues Fixed:

### ✅ 1. Date Input Font Color
**Problem:** Date inputs had light gray font in light mode  
**Solution:** Updated CSS to show black font in light mode, gray in dark mode
**File:** `css/app.css` lines 561-582

### ✅ 2. Stats Calculation Logic - COMPLETELY REWRITTEN
**Problem:** Incorrect company vs competitor calculation  
**Correct Logic Implemented:**
- When filtering by **company product**: 
  - Company cases = all company cases
  - Competitor cases = all competitor cases (EXCLUDING mixed)
  - Company units = all company units
  - Competitor units = ALL competitor units in system
  
- When filtering by **competitor product**:
  - Competitor cases = all competitor cases  
  - Company cases = all company cases (EXCLUDING mixed)
  - Competitor units = all competitor units
  - Company units = ALL company units in system

- When filtering by **category/subcategory**: Apply same logic but only for products in that category/subcategory

**File:** `js/caseAnalytics.js` - `computeCaseMetricsWithSubcategoryFilter()` function lines 118-266

### ✅ 3. Product Dropdown Searchable Feature Removed
**Problem:** Console error "Find Error - No matching column found: line" and unresponsive dropdown  
**Solution:** Removed `makeSelectSearchable('filter-case-product')` and `makeSelectSearchable('dashboard-filter-product')` calls
**Files:** 
- `js/admin.js` - removed calls at lines 2566 and 3203

### ✅ 4. Cascading Filters Implemented in admin.js
**Feature:** Company → Category → SubCategory → Product filters now cascade
- Selecting company filters categories to only that company's categories
- Selecting category filters subcategories to only that category's subcategories  
- Selecting subcategory filters products to only that subcategory's products
- This solves the long product dropdown issue!

**Files:**
- `js/admin.js` - Added `setupCascadingFilters()` function in both `setupCaseFilters()` and `setupDashboardFilters()`

## Still TODO:
- [ ] Apply cascading filters to employee.js (cases and dashboard)
- [ ] Apply cascading filters to manager.js (dashboard, team cases, manager cases)
- [ ] Remove makeSelectSearchable calls from employee.js and manager.js
